# TAS-Script Utilities

This program contains utilities that can be useful when managing TAS script files:

Remove line numbers: removes line numbers from the beginning of each line

Number lines: removes all existing line numbers and renumbers lines sequentially (good for merging scripts; make sure all scripts have blank lines included because skips in numbering will be ignored)

Write out empty lines: writes out all empty lines that have been omitted from a script

Remove empty lines: removes all empty lines from a script to save space
